How to release a new version of CubicTest
-------------------------------------------

* Make sure you have the latest version of Eclipse, GEF and Subclipse svn (install as primary workspace)

* Make sure that the Eclipse compiler is set to Java 1.5

* Make sure you have the latest version of Selenium. 
 -  To upgrade Selenium, 
   1) put jars in the project CubicTestSeleniumRC/lib, 
   2) pack them into a fat-jar (using the fat-jar plugin(1))
   3) put the fat-jar into 
        - CubicTestSeleniumExporter/lib
        - CubicRecorder/lib
   
* Check that license is inserted on all source files

* Upgrade the version number 
 - search and replace in all files 
 - rename jar and pom files as well

* Package the CubicTestPlugin into a fat-jar file (using the fat-jar plugin(1))
   1) pack all files into a fat-jar (see txt file with required contents)
   2) put the fat-jar into 
       - CubicTestSeleniumExporter/lib
 
* Package the CubicTestSeleniumExporter into a jar file
   1) pack all files into a jar (use standard Eclipse jar export)
   2) put the jar into CubicTestSeleniumExporter/lib

* Build the Update Site
   - Apply the build to a *fresh* Eclipse installation each time (as Update Site files are cached,
     so you will only get the old files again if you uninstall and reinstall same version number).

* Build the rich client version
	1) Compute dependencies CubicTest.product
	2) Export CubicTest.product

* Deploy to update site (including zip'ed version for local update sites) 

* Deploy to maven repository (including zip'ed version for zip downloads) 

* Deploy rich client version

* Release Jira version

* Update meta.xml in website dir with release info
