How to release a new version of CubicTest
-------------------------------------------

* Make sure you have the latest version of Eclipse, GEF and Subclipse (install as primary workspace)

* Make sure that the Eclipse compiler is set to Java 1.5

* Make sure you have the latest version of Selenium. 
 -  To upgrade Selenium, 
   1) put jars in the project CubicTestSeleniumRC/lib, 
   2) pack them into a fat-jar
   3) put the fat-jar into CubicTestSeleniumExporter/lib
   
* Check that license is inserted on all source files

* Upgrade the version number 
 - search and replace in all files 
 - rename jar and pom files as well
 
* Package the CubicTestSeleniumExporter into a fat-jar file
   1) pack all files into a fat-jar (see txt file with required contents)
   2) put the fat-jar into 
       - CubicTestSeleniumExporter/lib
       - CubicRecorder/lib
 
* Build the Update Site
   - Apply the build to a *fresh* Eclipse installation each time (as Update Site files are cached,
     so you will only get the old files again if you uninstall and reinstall same version number).
     
* Copy the generated update site files to the release candidate update site:
	http://boss.bekk.no/cubictest/update-release-candidates/theVersion-RCx

* Distribute links, release acceptance test

* Deploy to main update site (TODO)
